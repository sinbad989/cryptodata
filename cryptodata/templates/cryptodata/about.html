        <h1>About Us.</h1>
        <p>it is beneficial to keep a collection of information about the cryptocurrencies 
                in your portfolio or the assets you might want to keep an eye out for. This way, 
                when new information erupts, you can just add it to your document without having to 
                compile full research every time you want to refresh yourself about the project. 
                You can consider it as keeping a diary of cryptocurrencies you are invested in.</p>
